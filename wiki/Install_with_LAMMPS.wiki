#Brief instruction on the installation of fix-phonon along with LAMMPS

= Introduction =

The installation of fix-phonon together with LAMMPS is pretty simple, there is no special requirement for fix-phonon other than those needed by LAMMPS. The following procedure will generally work for all.


= Details =

If you know how to use svn to check out the latest version, follow this procedure:
----
  # *Download [http://lammps.sandia.gov/ LAMMPS]*; and then untar it;
  # *check out fix-phonon* under _src_ of LAMMPS:
   svn checkout http://fix-phonon.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ USER-PHONON
  # *edit Makefile* under _src_, append "user-phonon" to the variable "PACKUSER";
  # *make yes-kspace*;
  # *make yes-user-phonon*;
  # *make your-platform*; here _your-platform_ should correspond to the correct Makefile under MAKE that works for your platform.
----
Otherwise, follow this procedure:
----
  # *Download [http://lammps.sandia.gov/ LAMMPS]*; and then untar it;
  # *Download* the appropriate version of [http://code.google.com/p/fix-phonon/downloads/list Fix-Phonon]; untar it under the _src_ directory of your untarred lammps; 
  # *edit Makefile* under _src_, append "*user-phonon*" to the variable "PACKUSER";
  # *make yes-kspace*;
  # *make yes-user-phonon*;
  # *make your-platform*; here _your-platform_ should correspond to the correct Makefile under MAKE that works for your platform.
 ----
Then everything should work for you. One can check the document under _USER-PHONON/doc_ as well as the examples in _USER-PHONON/Examples_ for the usage of fix-phonon.

The postprocessing code locates in _USER-PHONON/postproc_, for the installation, check the README file and/or [http://code.google.com/p/fix-phonon/wiki/InstructionOnPostprocessingCode here].
