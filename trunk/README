The files in this directory are a user-contributed package for LAMMPS.

This package implements the method to measure the dynamical matrices
and consequently the phonon dispersion directly from molecular dynamics
simulations, as a new fix to LAMMPS: FixPhonon.

See the documentation file of this command for detailed usage.

The compiling of this package along with LAMMPS requires that the FFT3d
wrappers from the kspace package of LAMMPS be included as well.

Besides, you should also append 'user-phonon' to the 'PACKUSER' variable
in the file of src/Makefile before invoke `make yes-user-phonon`.

For installation, please refer to file INSTALL.

For usage, please check the doc and example directories.
